<p>A *.obj to CSS3 converter.</p>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>

<p>c3d can read object files (.obj) made by 3D programs (Cinema4D, 3dMax, Blender, ...) and display them in HTML/CSS3.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>The model properties in the object files are translated to CSS3 transforms. For every face on the 3D model, there's a corresponding HTML-element which can be used as every other HTML element in your DOM: put more HTML on it, define event handlers (onclick, onmouseover, ...)!</p>

<p>Once the model is loaded, you'll get access to a camera element, which allows you to rotate around the model, zoom in, zoom out, pan, etc.</p>

<h2>So... Is it THAT cool?</h2>

<p>Yes, but... there are some limitations.</p>

<p>As CSS3 is not fully capable of every 3D goodie your 3D program might have, not everything can be displayed in the HTML representation.</p>

<p>Here are some things that already work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Import models with an arbitrary number of faces</li>
<li>Display arbitrary HTML on every face</li>
<li>Have flat shading (basic lightning) for your object</li>
<li>Camera movements are smoothly animated</li>
<li>Pretty good performance </li>
</ul><p>These things are coming soon, I already did them successfully but did not include into the library yet:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Soft" point light, with gradients and a single specular</li>
<li>Move camera to a defined face automatically

<ul>
<li>This is a convencience feature, but as this lib is for websites, I think it's an important one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beautifully rendered shadows and lightning on the faces as you see it in your 3D program</li>
<li>Ambient Occlusion</li>
<li>Rotate/Move 3D objects individually (not only the camera)</li>
</ul><p>Things I didn't do yet and will be mid-term limitations of this library:</p>

<ul>
<li>Faces with 3 or more than 4 vertices

<ul>
<li>make sure the faces in your model have exactly 4 vertices</li>
<li>Additionally, faces need to be parallelograms</li>
<li>Practically, this means that you shouldn't change the vertices of your rectangular faces individually unless you know what you do</li>
<li>This is mainly a limitation of HTML/CSS itself, as HTML elements are rectangular (no triangles)

<ul>
<li>There are ways to work around this and I will certainly try to do that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Things that may be never possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Perfect" shading as seen in the 3D programs</li>
<li>3D program render settings like Stereocams, Motion blur, Depth of field, ...</li>
</ul><h2>How to use it?</h2>

<p>I will publish tutorials and the expected workflow here.</p>

<p>That's it for now! Stay tuned, watch the repo.</p>
